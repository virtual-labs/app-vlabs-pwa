**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Virtual Labs PWA</span>_**

Overview:

This app displays all experiments hosted under the virtual labs site. It allows users to filter and search for experiments that interest them. The app is also a PWA and what this means is that the app is mobile compatible and can run completely offline.

The app has also been converted to an apk and hosted on the android play store. The app works seamlessly and due to using MUI Joy in combination with React, the app looks and feels like a native android app.

The PWA has been deployed to ‘[https://app.vlabs.ac.in](https://app.vlabs.ac.in/)’
